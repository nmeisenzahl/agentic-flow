# agentic-flow — Usage Reference

Quick reference for adopters: slash commands, pipeline overview, and configuration.

## Slash Commands

Slash commands are posted as comments on Feature issues or spec PRs.

| Command | Posted on | Trigger | Preconditions | Output |
|---------|-----------|---------|---------------|--------|
| `/retry-triage` | Feature issue | Re-runs Phase 0 triage | None | Issue reformatted, labels re-evaluated |
| `/start-spec` | Feature issue | Starts Phase 2 spec generation | `research-complete` label; no `needs-refinement` | Draft spec PR created; `spec.md` generated |
| `/refine-spec` | Spec PR | Regenerates `spec.md` on open spec branch | Open spec PR; `spec.md` exists on branch; no `plan.md` yet | Updated `spec.md` committed to existing branch; PR review comment |
| `/approve-spec` | Spec PR | Starts Phase 3 plan generation | `spec.md` exists on branch; no `plan.md` yet; no `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION:]` in spec.md | `plan.md` generated; review comment on same PR |
| `/approve-plan` | Spec PR | Starts Phase 4 tasks generation | `spec.md` and `plan.md` exist on branch; no `tasks.md` yet; no `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION:]` in plan.md | `tasks.md` generated; `ready-to-merge` applied on PASS |

**Note**: `/start-spec` and `/retry-triage` are phase-trigger commands, not approval gates. `/refine-spec` updates `spec.md` without advancing the pipeline. The four approval gates are: (1) answer clarifying questions, (2) `/approve-spec` (on spec PR), (3) `/approve-plan` (on spec PR), (4) merge the spec PR.

## Pipeline Overview

### From the User's Perspective

| Step | You do | Happens automatically |
|------|--------|-----------------------|
| 1 | Open a Feature issue | Triage: issue formatted, `needs-spec` label applied |
| 2 | — | Research: findings appended to issue body; notification comment |
| 3 | Review research; post `/start-spec` | Spec: draft PR + `spec.md` generated via quality gate chain |
| 4 | Review spec; answer clarifications; post `/approve-spec` on the spec PR | Plan: `plan.md` generated via quality gate chain |
| 5 | Review plan; post `/approve-plan` on the spec PR | Tasks: `tasks.md` generated; `ready-to-merge` applied on PASS |
| 6 | Review tasks; merge spec PR | Post-merge: Task issues created, linked as sub-issues |
| 7 | Pick up Task issues from Ready for Development | — |

### In-PR Iteration with `/refine-spec`

After step 3 (reviewing the spec), you may have substantive feedback that requires regenerating the spec rather than just commenting. Use `/refine-spec` to incorporate reviewer feedback into a revised `spec.md` without restarting the pipeline:

1. Post review comments on the spec PR
2. Comment `/refine-spec` on the spec PR
3. The `refine.md` agent reads all open review comments and regenerates `spec.md` on the existing branch
4. Review the updated spec and continue from step 4 when satisfied

**When to use `/refine-spec` vs just commenting**: Use `/refine-spec` when you have structural or requirements-level feedback that changes what is specified. For minor wording fixes or clarifications that don't affect scope, comment directly and post `/approve-spec` on the spec PR when ready.

**Constraint**: `/refine-spec` cannot be used after `/approve-spec` has already run (`plan.md` exists on the branch). At that point, update `plan.md` directly on the spec PR branch as needed and use `/approve-plan` only when the plan is ready to proceed to tasks generation.

### Phase Timing

| Phase | Typical duration |
|-------|-----------------|
| 0 Triage | ≤5 minutes |
| 1 Research | ≤15 minutes |
| 2 Spec | ≤10 minutes after `/start-spec` |
| 3 Plan | ≤10 minutes after `/approve-spec` |
| 4 Tasks | ≤10 minutes after `/approve-plan` |
| 5 Post-merge | ≤5 minutes after merge |

Total human interaction time (not including reading/thinking): ≤30 minutes

## Label-Stuck Recovery

If a pipeline phase crashes mid-run, labels may get stuck. Use these commands to clean up:

```bash
# research-in-progress stuck (research agent crashed)
gh issue edit {ISSUE_NUMBER} --remove-label research-in-progress

# needs-spec not applied after triage
gh issue edit {ISSUE_NUMBER} --add-label needs-spec

# spec-in-progress stuck after spec PR was closed
gh issue edit {ISSUE_NUMBER} --remove-label spec-in-progress
```

---

## Common Workflows

### Re-run Triage

Post `/retry-triage` as a comment on the issue. Triage is idempotent — it will update the structured sections without duplicating the `<!-- original-body -->` block.

### Skip Research (not recommended)

If you need to bypass research (e.g., for a simple housekeeping task), manually apply `research-complete` label:
```bash
gh issue edit {ISSUE_NUMBER} --add-label research-complete
```
Then post `/start-spec`.

### Re-run a Phase

All slash commands are idempotent:
- `/approve-spec` with an existing `plan.md` → shows idempotency notice
- `/approve-plan` with an existing `tasks.md` → shows idempotency notice

Re-running `/start-spec` when a spec PR exists → agent posts link to the existing PR instead of creating a duplicate.

### Re-run Post-merge

Re-run `post-merge.yml` from the GitHub Actions UI. The workflow is idempotent — it skips tasks whose issues already exist (detected via a hidden `<!-- agentic-flow:feature={N}:task={id} -->` marker in the issue body).

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Workflow doesn't trigger | Check coding agent is enabled; verify `.lock.yml` is committed |
| Agent can't write to repo | Ensure GitHub MCP server is active in Settings → Copilot → MCP servers |
| Research doesn't start | Verify `research-trigger.yml` has `actions: write` permission; check `needs-spec` label exists |
| `gh aw compile` fails | Run `gh aw compile --actionlint` for details |
| Sub-issues not linking | Confirm `sub_issue_id` is the integer `id` field, not `node_id` |
| Wrapper agent never starts after slash command | Verify `GH_AW_AGENT_TOKEN` is configured; `/refine-spec`, `/approve-spec`, and `/approve-plan` use it for the PR reassignment + startup-comment handoff that launches the wrapper agent |
| `/start-spec` rejected | Check issue has `research-complete` label; verify no `needs-refinement` label is set |
| `/refine-spec` rejected | Verify open spec PR exists and `plan.md` is NOT yet on the branch |
| `/approve-spec` rejected | Verify `spec.md` exists on the spec PR's branch and command was posted on the spec PR |
| `/approve-plan` rejected | Verify both `spec.md` and `plan.md` exist on the branch and command was posted on the spec PR |

## Pipeline Walkthrough

A complete feature flows through these phases:

| Phase | Who acts | What happens |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **0 — Triage** | Agent (auto) | `triage-trigger.yml` fires on issue open → `triage.md` reformats the issue, classifies it |
| **1 — Research** | Agent (auto) | `research-trigger.yml` fires on `needs-spec` label → `research.md` appends findings to issue |
| **2 — Spec** | You (post `/start-spec`) | `spec.md` creates a tracking sub-issue, dispatches `agentic-flow-spec`, and the assigned agent works on the auto-created branch/draft PR |
| *(optional)* **Refine** | You (post `/refine-spec` on PR) | `refine.md` reads PR review comments and regenerates `spec.md` on the existing branch |
| **3 — Plan** | You (post `/approve-spec` on spec PR) | `plan.md` dispatches `agentic-flow-plan`; generates `plan.md` and any speckit-required plan-stage outputs on the spec branch |
| **4 — Tasks** | You (post `/approve-plan` on spec PR) | `tasks.md` dispatches `agentic-flow-tasks`; generates `tasks.md`, any speckit-required tasks-stage outputs, and applies `ready-to-merge` on PASS |
| **5 — Post-merge** | You (merge the PR) | `post-merge.yml` creates Task sub-issues |

## Failure Modes Reference

| Failure | Likely Cause | Recovery |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Triage doesn't fire | Coding agent disabled or `.lock.yml` not committed | Enable coding agent in Settings → Copilot → Coding agent; verify `triage.lock.yml` is committed |
| Research label stuck | `research.md` crashed after label apply | `gh issue edit {N} --remove-label research-in-progress`, then re-dispatch |
| `/start-spec` rejected — needs refinement | Issue body lacks enough detail | Update issue with more detail; run `/retry-triage` to reclassify |
| `/start-spec` rejected — no research | Phase 1 didn't complete | Manually dispatch `research.lock.yml` or check agent settings |
| `spec.md` still has unresolved clarifications | `agentic-flow-spec` exhausted its clarify/analyze loop and surfaced findings for human review | Address the findings in the spec PR, push, then comment `/approve-spec` on the spec PR |
| `ready-to-merge` not applied | Quality gate found outstanding issues | Review the PR comment; address findings or manually apply label |
| Sub-issues not linked | Sub-issues beta not enabled | Enable sub-issues in Settings → General |
